SSGM - Silent Small Gaming Machine

## Goals for this project

1. As small as possible (ditch large HDDs, CDROM drives, etc)
1. As quiet as possible (put in large fans where possible)
1. Fit 2x SLI GTX 680s that I already have
1. Use the best components possible

## Spec

* Asus ROG Maximus VII Gene Z97 motherboard
* Intel Core i7 4770K overclocked
* Be Quiet! Dark Rock Pro 3 CPU Cooler
* Samsung 840 EVO 1TB SSD
* Corsair Vengence Low Profile 32GB DDR3 RAM
* Corsair RM850 PSU

Could not reuse Antec Gamer 900 PSU as non-modular design meant far too many extra cables.
